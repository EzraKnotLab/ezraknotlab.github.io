<p>Whenever there's a new tech&amp;product coming out, it always triggers a hot discussion on the internet. Mainly these days, people wonder whether it's necessary to learn languages &quot;in person&quot;? As a matter of fact, we've already used AI models to generate code for so many times, so is it vital that I could handle the code without AI? &quot;One thing I am reasonably confident predicting, however, is that LLMs won’t make learning obsolete, &quot; Scott Young wrote in the newsletter. He took paper writing and a calculator as examples. The saying goes, 'The palest ink is better than the best memory.' We no longer need to memorize speeches if the full text is written down. To some extent, our memory of the mind gets released. While they certainly eliminate the need to learn some skills (I have no idea how to use a slide rule, for instance), we still have to understand arithmetic to use a calculator to get the answer we seek, even if the machine does the actual computation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowledge outside your head doesn’t count, since it can’t participate in learning and reasoning.<br>
The ability to look something up is not a substitute for having knowledge in your head.<br>
Understanding an LLM’s answer depends heavily on the knowledge you already possess.<br>
Your own knowledge allows you to extract knowledge from the LLM more accurately.<br>
LLMs may accelerate the need for knowledge, since the combination of [knowledgeable person + ChatGPT] will outperform [ignorant person + ChatGPT] by a wider margin than exists between the two people on their own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From what I can see, like generating codes by ChatGPT, it'd be better if the users are capable of reading, finding out the errors and correcting the codes.<br>
Wait but somehow all these products which are tokens as examples are not as epoch-making as LLMs. So we can barely see it that way. Or maybe LLMs are not that epoch-making yet, we all can just see it as a new-era tool. The larger and stronger-impact AI products are in the way...</p>
<p>Physical labour can be replaced by AI techs definitely. But even sophisticated enough tasks like chess have already been proven that can defeat in front of AI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the extreme case, all bets are off. Perhaps we’ll live in a utopian future where machines do all the work and people do cognitive activities for leisure or showing off, much like gardening is a hobby, not agriculture. Or perhaps we’ll all get turned into paperclips. Who knows?</p>

<p>The UFC 288 fight card was built around one of the greatest bantamweight champions--Aljamain Sterling. The undisputed belt holder has already defended his crown twice against the former champions, Peter Yan and TJ Dillashaw. Domestically the fighting style of the division's current king is not much fond by fans. POV: relatively poor stand-up skills and boring ground style. But regardless, this third title defence leads him to the achievement that being the first-ever bantamweight champion successfully defend the title 3 times consecutively. The challenger, Henry Cejudo has already harvested all the reputation a man could in this business. This also reminds me of what Pep did to Erling Haaland when the latter almost got 5 goals in one champions league match. During the shower, I thought having too fruitful awards at an early age isn't that good to be a GOAT. 3C's performance was unbelievable and those TD were fabulous from all perspectives. Aljo took down 3C several times and the former two-division champion has only been taken down once!!! Physically Aljo has much more advantages over 3C in reach length and so on. All five rounds were extremely close, but as you may already be familiar with, it won't be easy for the challenger to take away the belt. So the split win for AS is acceptable personally. Hope 3C wouldn't retire after this, cause Branden Moreno has unfinished business with him and 3C's status is good to be a contender.<br>

<p>The co-main event was a potential title qualifier fight between Belal Muhammad and Gilbert Burns. It seems like Burns show every weekend on the fight nights, lol. A lot of respect for him. Belal landed many leg kicks to his rival's body and head in the early two rounds. Burns tried to block with his arms partially and his left arm was uncomfortable. So it's pretty tough for &quot;Durinho&quot; to harm his opponent heavily. In the end, Belal Muhammad Defeats Gilbert Burns by Decision. Much respect between both.<br>

<p>And China power!! Yan Xiaonan was patient, and smart with some moves and hurt Jéssica Andrade at the beginning of the fight. While Jéssica was chasing and aiming to land some shots, Yan dodged and take a right nuclear punch to Jéssica's chin. Finally, Yan won by KO for the first time in her career. More importantly winning this contender fight give her a title short, namely Chinese Derby with Zhang Weili.<br>

<p>Life is a dramatic story all about exploration. Maybe all we need to be successful is the timing to grasp the chances. It's not necessarily your whole lifetime， but certain ages around your twenties. Henry Cejudo won the Olympic gold medal in 2008 and retired from UFC as a two-division champion. BTW, the most impressive part is that with all these wars he's been through, he comes back only at 36. Today he returned for the UFC bantamweight belt which was never truly lost. Triple C lost the title fight by a split decision to Aljo Sterling, unfortunately. But okay, we trust the process! The walkout song (Lupe Fiasco - The Show Goes On) of the king reminds me of Sth. Take your time.<br>
