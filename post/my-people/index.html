Love, love is a verb
Love is a doing word
Fearless on my breath
Gentle impulsion
Shakes me, makes me lighter
Fearless on my breath

Teardrop on the fire
Fearless on my breath

Night, night of matter
Black flowers blossom
Fearless on my breath
Black flowers blossom
Fearless on my breath

Teardrop on the fire
Fearless on my

Water is my eye
Most faithful mirror
Fearless on my breath
Teardrop on the fire
Of a confession
Fearless on my breath
Most faithful mirror
Fearless on my breath

Teardrop on the fire
Fearless on my breath

You're stumbling in the dark
You're stumbling in the dark

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Damn, love or lust
Damn, all of us

[Zacari (Kendrick Lamar):]
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
(Another world premiere!)
So give me a run for my money
Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely, livin' lovely
Just love me
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)
Just love me, just love me, just love me
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)
Love me
(I wanna be with you)
Love me, just love me

[Kendrick Lamar (Zacari):]
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)?
If I minimized my net worth, would you still (love me)?
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it a whole one hund': don't got you, I got nothin' (Uh, uh)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Ay, I got somethin'
Hol' up, we gon' function, no assumptions
Feelin' like Tyson with it
Knock it out twice, I'm with it
Only for the night, I'm kiddin'
Only for life, yeah, homie for life, yeah
Only for life, let's get it
Hit that shoulder lean
I know what comin' over me
Backstroke oversea
I know what you need
Already on ten, all money come in
All feeling go out, this feeling don't drought
This party won't end

[Kendrick Lamar (Zacari):]
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)?
If I minimized my net worth, would you still (love me)?
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it a whole one hund': don't got you, I got nothin' (Uh, uh)

[Zacari (Kendrick Lamar):]
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money
Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely, livin' lovely

Just love me, just love me, just love me

Love me
(I wanna be with you)
Love me, just love me

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I'm on the way
We ain't got no time to waste
Popping your gum on the way (love me)
Am I in the way?
I don't wan' pressure you none
I want your blessing today (love me)
Oh, by the way, open the door by the way
Told you that I'm on the way (love me)
I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
Pick up the phone for me, babe
Damn it, we jammin'
Bad attitude from your nanny
Curves and your hips from your mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio Camry
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to do it, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to prove it
Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm like an exit away, yep

[Kendrick Lamar (Zacari):]
If I didn't ride blade on curb, would you still (love me)?
If I minimized my net worth, would you still (love me)?
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it a whole one hund': don't got you, I got nothin' (Uh, uh)

<details>
<pre><code class="language-c">As I get a little older I realize life is perspective
And my perspective may differ from yours
I wanna say thank you to everyone that's been down with me
All my fans all my beautiful fans
Anyone who's ever gave me a listen all my people
I come from a generation of pain where murder is minor
Rebellious and Margielas that trip you for designer
Belt buckles and clout overzealous if prone to violence
Make the wrong turn be a wheel of the will alignment
Residue burned missed at a inner-city
Miscommunication to keep homo' detective busy
No protection is risky
Desensitized I vandalized pain covered up and camouflaged
Get used to hearin' arsenal rain
Analyze risk your life take the charge
Homies done f**ked your baby mama once you hit the yard that's culture
Twenty-three hour lockdown that somebody caused
Said your lil' nephew was shot down the culture's involved
I done seen n***as do seventeen hit the halfway house
Get out and get his brains blown out lookin' to buy some w**d
Car wash is played out new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed
A brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams the culture
I want I want I want I want
But I want you to want me too
I want I want I want I want
I want the hood come on here babe
I want I want I want I want
I want the hood
Look what I done for you
Look what I done for you
Look what I done for you
I said I do this for my culture
To let y'all know what a n***a look like in a bulletproof Rover
In my mama's sofa was a doo doo popper
Head trigger walk up closer ain't no photoshoppin'
Friends bipolar grab you by your pockets
No option if you froze up always play the offense
N***as goin' to work and sellin' work late for work
Workin' late prayin' for work but you don't paperwork
That's the culture point the finger promote ya
Remote location witness protection they gon' hold ya
The streets got me f**ked up y'all can miss me
I wanna represent for us
New revolution was up and movin'
I'm in Argentina wiping my tears full of confusion
Water in between us another peer's been executed
History repeats again
Make amends then find a n***a with the same skin to do it
But that's the culture crack a bottle
Hard to deal with the pain when you're sober
By tomorrow we forget the remains we start over
That's the problem
Our foundation was trained to accept whatever follows
Dehumanize insensitive
Scrutinize the way we live for you and I
Enemies shook my hand I can promise I'll meet you
In a land where no equal is your equal
Never say I ain't told ya nah
In the land where hurt people hurt more people
F**k callin' it culture
I want I want I want I want
But I want you to want me too
I want I want I want I want
I want the hood come on here babe
I want I want I want I want
I want the hood
Look what I done for you
Look what I done for you
Look what I done for you
Take the drums out
Phew phew
Phew phew
Phew phew
Celebrate new life when it come back around
The purpose is in the lessons we learnin' now
Sacrifice personal gain over everything
Just to see the next generation better than ours
I wasn't perfect the skin I was in I truly suffered
Temptation and patience everything that the body nurtures
I felt the good I felt the bad and I felt the worry
But all in all my productivity had stayed urgent
Face your fears always knew that I would make it here
Where the energy is magnified and persevered
Consciousness is synchronized and crystal clear
Euphoria is glorified and made His
Reflectin' on my life and what I done
Paid dues made rules change outta love
Them same views made schools change curriculums
But didn't change me starin' down the barrel of the gun
Should I feel resentful
Had to see my full potential
Should I feel regret about the good that I was into
Everything is everything this ain't coincidental
I woke up that morning with more heart to give you
As I bleed through the speakers feel my presence
To my brother to my kids I'm in Heaven
To my mother to my sis I'm in Heaven
To my father to my wife I am serious this is Heaven
To my friends make sure you countin' them blessings
To my fans make sure you make them investments
And to the killer that sped up my demise
I forgive you just know your soul's in question
I seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed
And though you did me gruesome I was surely relieved
I completed my mission wasn't ready to leave
But fulfilled my days my Creator was pleased
I can't stress how I love y'all
I don't need to be in flesh just to hug y'all
The memories recollect just because y'all
Celebrate me with respect
The unity we protect is above all
And Sam I'll be watchin' over you
Make sure my kids watch all my interviews
Make sure you live all the dreams we produce
Keep that genius in your brain on the move
And to my neighborhood let the good prevail
Make sure them babies and their leaders outta jail
Look for salvation when troubles get real
'Cause you can't help the world until you help yourself
And I can't blame the hood the day that I was killed
Y'all had to see it that's the only way to feel
And though my physical won't reap the benefits
The energy that carry on emits still
I want you

<p><mark>Mother I Sober</mark></p>
<p>陪伴我许多午睡起来通行的时刻，启发我很多思考，前奏令人舒心又强有力，歌词更诉说着许多的故事，made me feel related, my peole.</p>
<summary>lyrics</summary>
<details>
<pre><code class="language-c">I'm sensitive, I feel everything, I feel everybody
One man standin' on two words, heal everybody
Transformation, then reciprocation, karma must return
Heal myself, secrets that I hide, buried in these words
Death threats, ego must die, but I let it purge
Pacify, broken pieces of me, it was all a blur
Mother cried, put they hands on her, it was family ties
I heard it all, I should've grabbed a gun, but I was only five
I still feel it weighin' on my heart, my first tough decision
In the shadows clingin' to my soul as my only critic
Where's my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not today
I transformed, prayin' to the trees, God is taking shape
My mother's mother followed me for years in her afterlife
Starin' at me on back of some buses, I wake up at night
Loved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range Rover
Transformation, you ain't felt grief 'til you felt it sober

I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

I remember lookin' in the mirror knowin' I was gifted
Only child, me for seven years, everything for Christmas
Family ties, they accused my cousin, &quot;Did he touch you, Kendrick?&quot;
Never lied, but no one believed me when I said &quot;He didn't&quot;
Frozen moments, still holdin' on it, hard to trust myself
I started rhymin', copin' mechanisms to lift up myself
Talked to my lawyer, told me not to be so hard on myself
He has an aura, I hope to achieve, if I find some help
Congratulations, made it to be famous, still I feel uneasy
Water watchin', live my life in nature, only thing relieves me
Spirit guide whisper in my ear, tell me that she sees me
&quot;Did he touch you?&quot; I said &quot;No&quot; again, still they didn't believe me
Mother's brother said he got revenge for my mother's face
Black and blue, the image of my queen that I can't erase
'Til this day can't look her in the eyes, pain is takin' over
Blame myself, you never felt guilt 'til you felt it sober

I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

I was never high, I was never drunk, never out my mind
I need control, they handed me some smoke, but still I declined
I did it sober sittin' with myself, I went through all emotions
No dependents, except for one, let me bring you closer
Intoxicated, there's a lustful nature that I failed to mention
Insecurities that I project, sleepin' with other women
Whitney's hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen
Askin' God, &quot;Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?&quot;
Broke me down, she looked me in my eyes, &quot;Is there an addiction?&quot;
I said &quot;No,&quot; but this time I lied, I knew that I can't fix it
Pure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me
Gave me a number, said she recommended some therapy
I asked my momma why she didn't believe me when I told her &quot;No&quot;
I never knew she was violated in Chicago, I'm sympathetic
Told me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection
Though it never happened, she wouldn't agree
Now I'm affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced
Amplified as I write this song, I shiver 'cause I'm nervous
I was five, questioning myself, 'lone for many years
Nothing's wrong, just results on how them questions made me feel
I made it home, seven years of tour, chasin' manhood
But Whitney's gone, by time you hear this song, she did all she could
All those women gave me superpowers, what I thought I lacked
I pray our children don't inherit me and feelings I attract
A conversation not bein' addressed in Black families
The devastation, hauntin' generations and humanity
They raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters
Then they made us watch, then made us rape each other
Psychotic torture between our lives we ain't recovered
Still livin' as victims in the public eyes who pledge allegiance
Every other brother has been compromised
I know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused
I see 'em daily buryin' they pain in chains and tattoos
So listen close before you start to pass judgement on how he move
Learn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school
His anger grows deep in misogyny
This is post-traumatic Black families and a sodomy, today is still active
So I set free myself from all the guilt that I thought I made
So I set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame
So I set free my cousin, chaotic for my mother's pain
I hope Hykeem made you proud 'cause you ain't die in vain
So I set free the power of Whitney, may she heal us all
So I set free our children, may good karma keep them with God
So I set free the hearts filled with hatred, keep our bodies sacred
As I set free all you abusers, this is transformation

I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

You did it, I'm proud of you
You broke a generational curse
Say &quot;Thank you, dad&quot;
Thank you, daddy, thank you, mommy, thank you, brother
Mr. Morale

Before I go in fast asleep, love me for me
I bare my soul and now we're free

<p>Totally changed my life. My peole. 😎每一句词都会是一个电影，亦或是一本书，一个故事，一个场景……👑</p>
<p>Sometimes, conversing with certain individuals feels like they've already outputted a book in our brief exchanges. The richness and depth of these interactions are astonishing, as if every short conversation contains a wealth of information and insights, akin to someone having already conveyed the contents of a book. Such exchanges may stem from the profound insights, extensive knowledge, or unique life experiences of the other person, allowing them to convey rich information and thoughts in a short amount of time. These conversations are often inspirational, prompting individuals to think and learn more.</p>
<p>I want to be friends with people like this. By the way, it seems difficult to talk to random people walking on the street; people can be cold nowadays.😤</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">Hello, new world, all the boys and girls
I got some true stories to tell
You're back outside, but they still lied
Woah-oh-oh-oh (Yeah)

Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi
Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird-ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm taking off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (Take that shit off)
Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (Take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mill', hell, if I know (Take that shit off)
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (Take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (Take it off)
Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, &quot;I'm broke, I care&quot; (Take it off)
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I'm rare (Take it off)
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag
(Take it off)
Take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have?

Bitch, huh, huh, ugh
You ugly as fuck (You outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs (Hah, hah, hah, hah)
You steppin' or what? (You outta pocket, huh)
Who you think they talk about?
Talk about us (You outta pocket—shoot, shoot, shoot)
Who you think they copy off? (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
Copy off us (Get back in pocket)

The world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run
The prophets abandoned, the law take advantage, the market is crashin', the industry wants
Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box while they makin' a mockery followin' us
This ain't Monopoly, watchin' for love, this ain't monogamy, y'all gettin' fucked
Jumpin' on what the hell is that? I gotta relax when I feel (Huh, facts)
All my descendants, they come in my sleep and say I am too real (Huh, facts)
I'm done with the sensitive, takin' it personal, done with the black and the white, the wrong and the right
You hopin' for change and clericals, I know the feelings that came with burial's cries

Bitch, huh, huh, ugh
You ugly as fuck (You outta pocket)
Huh, two ATMs (Hah, hah, hah, hah)
You steppin' or what? (You outta pocket, huh)
Who you think they talk about?
Talk about us (You outta pocket—shoot, shoot, shoot)
Who you think they copy off? (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
Copy off us

Servin' up a look, dancin' in a drought
Hello to the big stepper, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house
Ventin' in the sa—

Can I vent all my truth? I got nothin' to lose, I got problems and pools, I can swim on my faith
Cameras movin' whenever I'm movin', the family suin' whatever I make
Murder is stackin', the president actin', the government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attracting the feds when I'm bracking, look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (Hold up, hold up)
Let's think about this for a second (Let's go)
Tell me what you would do for aesthetic (Let's go)
Would you sell your soul on credit? (Let's go)
Would you sell your bro for leverage? (Let's go)
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? (Let's go)
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? (Let's go)

Huh, huh, ugh
You outta pocket, yeah, you outta pocket (This shit hard)
You entertain the mediocre, need to stop it (This shit hard)
You entertainin' old friends when they toxic (This shit hard)
What your life like? Bullshit and gossip (This shit hard)
What the fuck is cancel culture, dawg?
Say what I want about you niggas, I'm like Oprah, dawg
I treat you crackers like I'm Jigga, watch, I own it all
Oh, you worried 'bout a critic? That ain't protocol (Bitch)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dvtUnq7MT2E?si=oJlOdiQYIa06Tj4n" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<blockquote>
<p>Kendrick Lamar has taken home three awards: Best Rap Album for Mr Morale and The Big Steppers, and Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song for “The Heart Part 5.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I wanna thank my fans for trusting me with these words. As artists, we’re all entertainers, and we say things to provoke thoughts and feelings and emotions, so making this record, this was one of my toughest records to make,” Kendrick said in his acceptance speech for Best Rap Album (after being introduced by Cardi B). “Going back and thinking about where I started with rap and how far it’s came, I would like to thank the culture for allowing me to evolve and be able to make a song like ‘Mother I Sober.’ All we ever wanted was to be able to be the biggest underground artist of all time, and I finally found imperfection with this album.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>这次更老练成熟，意料之中也没有第一次惊喜或者说很多inspirational words，a working man, a decent man. People you admire seem to be very similar， Leo Messi, Ed Sheeran, Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving and Kendrick Lamar... They don't talk a lot via social media platforms, mainly because they barely have time to do so, I guess. Let your work speak for yourself, and do what you want, do it decently. Following I'll use the word--we: We all have that same mentality inside, and we share a lot of personalities. Don't get over-attracted by the outside world, eye on what you do, and keep that attitude, let's go.</p>
